## Project #1 : A Sudoku Solver using Graph Coloring

- **Update (2018/8/10) : include fstream library, only need to place test_data.txt in the same folder with .cpp file**

The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "subsquares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

### input format :

    1-2 3     // fill in row1 col2 with 3

    ...

    ^Z        // end with EOF
